# Contributing to VPrep_Interview_Bot
We invite everyone to join us in developing our interview agent (powered by Assembly AI and Gemini).  This project helps users improve their interview speaking skills.

We want to make contributing to this project as easy as possible.  You can

- Propose new features
- Report a bug
- Submit a fix

## We use the typical Github workflow with all proposed changes via pull requests.  Here are the steps:

1. Click the Fork button at [our repo](https://github.com/mainak0907/VPrep_Interview_Bot), clone to your computer, and then create and checkout your branch from `main`.
2. If coding some feature, create code and make sure your code passes your tests.
    * Use a consistent coding style like [this style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html).  For example, use const or let when declaring variables, use single quotes rather than double quotes, don't use line continuations.
    * Update the documentation with any dependency changes.
3. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## Contribute by creating a Github issue
We use GitHub issues to track changes. Just click the [New Issue button](https://github.com/mainak0907/VPrep_Interview_Bot/issues) and state your issue.

For example, a typical bug report should:

- Provide a clear and concise description of the problem.
- List steps to reproduce the problem
  - Be specific!
  - Include sample code if you can.
- What you expected to happen.
- What actually happened.
- What is your environment (OS and Browser version).
- Add logs or other helpful details.
